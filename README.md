# ðŸŽ® MATLAB Mini Games Suite

A multi-stage interactive game suite developed in **MATLAB**, designed to challenge players with a series of logic, memory, and word-based games. Each game must be successfully completed to proceed to the next, creating a progressive gameplay experience.

```
## ðŸ’¡ Game Flow

The player starts with **Guess What**, and must pass each game to advance. If the player fails a game, they will retry that game without restarting the entire suite. Once all five games are completed, the program ends with a final message.
